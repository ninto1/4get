# 4get
A 4chan image downloader (all images from a thread) I quickly botched together in 30 min

## Setup
Just clone the repo and run ```npm i```

## How to run
```node 4get.js```

## Motivation
I just wrote this because I didn't see the original 4get and wanted to download images of foxes. 

## Updates
IDK if I will ever touch this again. Feel free to contribute if you really think it is a good idea.

## Features
It does:
- dowload images
- crash sometimes
- accept just the board+thread number or a link
- automatically create a forlder for each thread
- detect if an image is already present and not download it again
- also download webms

It does not:
- monitor threads
- always work
- revenge the murder of your dog
- defend you from intercontinental ballistic missiles
