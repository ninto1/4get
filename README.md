# 4get
A 4chan image downloader (all images from a thread) I quickly botched together in 30 min

## Setup
Just clone the repo and run ```npm i```

## How to run
```node 4get.js```

## Motivation
I just wrote this because I didn't see the original 4get and wanted to download images of foxes. 

## Updates
IDK if I will ever touch this again. Feel free to contribute if you really think it is a good idea.
